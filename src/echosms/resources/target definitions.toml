# For each reference target, include a [[target]] section below.
#
# Where sensible, use names from the parameter section above for specifying 
# target parameters (e.g., the sound speed, density, size, etc). # The 'name' entry should be unique.
# Substitution of the parameter names with their values from the parameters section should be done in the 
# code that reads this file.
#
# The source item in each section should be used to identify the source of the model configuration.
# It is expected that most model configurations will come from existing reports and/or papers, so use
# a DOI or URL if avaiable, otherwise use a sufficiently detailed description of the source.
