# The initial version of this file contained all the DWBA shapes from the SDWBA.jl github repository.
# Looking to the future, each entry here includes a 'source' key to indicate where the data came from. Note
# that is not necessarily the original source of the data.

# To add more shapes, add extra [[shape]] sections. The 'name' entry should be unique.
# Units of x, y, z, and a are metres.
# g and h are the density and sound speed contrasts between the surrounding medium and the shape.

# The x, y, and z coordinates here should follow the echoSMs coordinate convention (https://ices-tools-dev.github.io/echoSMs/conventions)
# (in particular, all the shapes obtained from the SDWBA.jl repository had the z-axis pointing upwards and the head pointing in the
# negative x direction).


# This is commented out becasue the radius values (a) are sometimes negative. The source paper
# says that the shape is a prolate spheroid, but the shape in the data obtained from the 
# SDWBA.jl github repository has these negative values which makes the shape undetermined (or
# if the absolute value is taken, there are little 'tabs' and send end of the shape.
