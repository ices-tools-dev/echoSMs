# Spheres

The code in this directory provides exact solutions to scattering from spheres with various boundary conditions:

|Boundary condition|Function file|
|---|---|
|Elastic|`elastic_fs.m`|
|Elastic Cn|`elastic_cn_fs.m`|
|Fluid filled|`fluid_fs.m`|
|Near- and far-field elastic|`nf_elastic_fs.m`|
|Near- and far-field rigid fixed and pressure release|`nf_rgd_sft_fs.m`|
|Spherical shell|`shell_fs.m`|
|Rigid fixed and pressure release|`rgd_sft_fs.m`|

There are also various demonstration scripts in this directory.
