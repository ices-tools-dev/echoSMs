Hi Mike,
Nice to hear from you again. Hope you and Gavin had a wonderful holiday season!

I wrote a DWBA Matlab program package to compute backscattering by an elongated finite object with an elliptical cross-section (as a function along lengthwise direction) a few years ago, which is based on the new close-form analytical solutions. I provided that package (attached here) to Sven who implemented using R and is available online (Gaustauer et al., 2019).  The program (example_DWBA_ellipsolid.m) can calculate 22 different scenarios described from Line 45 to 67. 

I developed a new resonance-kirchhoff scattering model that was published in JMASJ (attached) and described in more detail in the attached docx file. However, since I currently don't have an active Matlab license and can't run the previous m-files (ex. the figures in the attached docx file) using the free Octave software (my matlab programs contain functions I don't have in my current Octave freeware). So I can't test Matlab scripts that run well on a different machine but I am sure you can implement the model easily based on my docx file with the help from Sven who provided the BEM results and also cc'ed here. This is also true for some models developed while I was at WHOI, working with Tim.

Best regards,
Chu
