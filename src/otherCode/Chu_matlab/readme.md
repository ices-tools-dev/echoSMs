# Dezhang Chu's Matlab code

This directory contains Matlab codes to calculate scattering from various shapes using various models.

The code was contributed by Dezhang Chu in 2026. The code was tested with version 2025b of Matlab and some edits made to have the code work and resolve Matlab editor warnings and suggestions. Readme files were also added in each model's directory.

The models here include:

- Elliptical DWBA
- Infinitely long cylinder
- Sphere scattering
- DWBA for zooplankton
