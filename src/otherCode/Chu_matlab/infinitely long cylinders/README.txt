Hi Mike & Gavin,
Here are two compressed files that provide the exact scattering models of simple shapes - spheres and infinitely long cylinders.

For spheres, you can view and run sphere_demo.m to see how it works. For cylinders, I don't have a demo m-file but it should be easy to figure out if you just read the functions, they need some parameters which are very easy to understand.

Let me know if you have any questions,

Chu
