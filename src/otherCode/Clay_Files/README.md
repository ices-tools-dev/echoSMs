# Clay files

This directory contains code by Clarence Clay that implements
the acoustic scattering models in Clay & Horne (1992), along with other work associated with the KRM scattering models.

It is provided as a historical record of the code and data behind a commonly-used scattering model that is still used today (over 30 years later).

The original commit of the files in this directory are unmodified from the original files provided by Mike Jech, which were recovered from an old Apple Mac floppy disk in 2025.

The code was written in the Microsoft QuickBasic for Mac language, version 1.0, and was likely run on an Apple Macintosh Plus or later computer. An open-source langauge available today (2025) that is mostly compatible with QuickBasic for Mac is [QuickBasic64](http://www.qb64.com).

Subsequent commits in this directory modify some of the programs to work with the QuickBasic64 compiler.
