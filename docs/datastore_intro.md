# Introduction

The echoSMs datastore is an online repository of acoustic scattering model input data.

The purpose is to:

1. Provide an open and accessible repository of anatomical fish and plankton data for use in acoustic scattering models,
1. Facilitate standardisation of data formats and metadata relevant to acoustic scattering model inputs,
1. Provide a web-accessible API for searching and accessing anatomical and model data,
1. Provide a web-based user interface for browsing, searching, uploading, and downloading datasets.

While the datastore is part of the echoSMs scattering model code base, it is not restricted to only being used with that code. The design and access method is sufficiently generic that any scattering model code can access and use the shapes and metadata.

???+ Note
    The datastore is under active development and we welcome feedback on all aspects of it. We are especially interested in whether the metadata is appropriate and sufficient, the web API is convenient to use, and in any other comments you may have with regards to the datastore's purpose and structure.
