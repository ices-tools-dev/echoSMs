# Other software

Other software that provides source code for acoustic scattering models of relevance to fisheries and plankton acoustics includes:

- [acousticTS](https://github.com/brandynlucca/acousticTS): R code for calculating scattering using the DCM, DWBA, SDWBA, SDWBA_curved, KRM, MSS model, as well as that of calibration spheres.
- [Coupled BEM acoustic](https://github.com/elavia/coupled_bem_acoustic): Julia code that calculates the TS of three-dimensional shapes with an included object (e.g., a swimbladder).
- [FishAcoustics](https://github.com/gavinmacaulay/FishAcoustics): Contains a Python module that implements the phase-tracking DWBA model.
- [Hydrac](https://hydrac.readthedocs.io/overview.html): Contains Python code that implements several exact and approximate scattering models, including the DWBA and high-pass models. Hydrac is a package for computing suspended matter concentrations from backscatter.
